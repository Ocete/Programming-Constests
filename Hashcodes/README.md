# Google Hashcodes

I've taken part in Google Hashcode twice, on 2018 and 2019. Both times with the same team:

[@Laucalle](https://github.com/Laucalle), [@dcabezas98](https://github.com/dcabezas98), [@yabirgb](https://github.com/yabirgb) and
[@Ocete](https://github.com/Ocete)

## 2018

Our solution, implemented on Python, can be found here:
https://github.com/yabirgb/hashcode/tree/master/2018
We got ranked 1503.

## 2019

We implemented a genetic algorithm on Python. It can be found here:
https://github.com/yabirgb/hashcode/tree/master/2018
However, we didn't manage to upload a valid solution on time.
